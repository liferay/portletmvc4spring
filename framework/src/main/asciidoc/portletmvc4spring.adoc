[[portlet-introduction]]
== Introduction

While the Spring Framework supports servlet-based development via Spring Web MVC, PortletMVC4Spring supports JSR-362
portlet development. As much as possible, PortletMVC4Spring is a mirror image of the Spring Web MVC framework, and also
uses the same underlying view abstractions and integration technology.

****
For more general information about portlet development, please review the https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=362[JSR-362
Specification] itself.
****

[NOTE]
====
Bear in mind that while most of the concepts of Spring Web MVC are the same in PortletMVC4Spring, there are some notable
differences created by the unique workflow of JSR-362 portlets.
====

The main way in which portlet workflow differs from servlet workflow is that the request to the portlet can have two
distinct phases: the `ACTION_PHASE` and the `RENDER_PHASE`. The `ACTION_PHASE` is executed only once and is where any
'backend' changes or actions occur, such as making changes in a database. The `RENDER_PHASE` then produces what is
displayed to the user each time the display is refreshed. The critical point here is that for a single overall request,
the `ACTION_PHASE` is executed only once, but the `RENDER_PHASE` may be executed multiple times. This provides (and
requires) a clean separation between the activities that modify the persistent state of your system and the activities
that generate what is displayed to the user. The Portlet 2.0 Specification added two more phases: The event phase and
the resource phase, both of which are supported by annotation-driven dispatching. The Portlet 3.0 Specification added
the header phase, but PortletMVC4Spring does not yet have annotation-driven dispatching support for it.

The multiple phases of portlet requests are one of the real strengths of the JSR-362 specification. Most other portlet
MVC frameworks attempt to completely hide the two phases from the developer and make it look as much like traditional
servlet development as possible - but this approach removes one of the main benefits of using portlets. This is why the
separation of the two phases is preserved throughout PortletMVC4Spring. The primary manifestation of this approach is
that where a Spring Web MVC controller might have a single handler method annotated with `@RequestMapping`, an
equivalent PortletMVC4Spring controller might have multiple handler methods, each utilizing one of `@ActionMapping`,
`@EventMapping`, `@RenderMapping`, or `@ResourceMapping`.

The framework is designed around a `DispatcherPortlet` that dispatches requests to handlers, with configurable handler
mappings and view resolution, just as the `DispatcherServlet` in the web framework does. File upload is also supported
in the same way.

Locale resolution and theme resolution are not supported in PortletMVC4Spring - these areas are in the purview of the
portal/portlet container and are not appropriate at the Spring level. However, all mechanisms in Spring that depend on
the locale (such as internationalization of messages) will still function properly because `DispatcherPortlet` exposes
the current locale in the same way as `DispatcherServlet`.



[[portlet-introduction-controller]]
=== Controllers - The C in MVC

The __modern__ approach for developing PortletMVC4Spring controller classes is to use the annotation-based programming
model. For detailed information, please refer to the section titled "<<portlet-annotation>>".

The __legacy__ approach is to have a controller class that implements the `Controller` interface (typically by extending
the `AbstractController` class). For detailed information, please refer to the section titled "<<portlet-controller>>".




[[portlet-introduction-view]]
=== Views - The V in MVC
All the view rendering capabilities of Spring Web MVC are used directly via a special bridge servlet named
`ViewRendererServlet`. By using this servlet, the portlet request is converted into a servlet request and the view can
be rendered using the entire normal Spring Web MVC infrastructure. This means all the existing renderers, such as JSP,
Thymeleaf, Velocity, etc., can be used within the portlet.



[[portlet-dispatcher]]
== The DispatcherPortlet

PortletMVC4Spring is a request-driven portlet MVC framework, designed around a portlet that dispatches requests to
controllers and offers other functionality facilitating the development of portlet applications. The PortletMVC4Spring
`DispatcherPortlet` however, does more than just that. It is completely integrated with the Spring `ApplicationContext`
and allows you to use every other feature Spring has.

Like ordinary portlets, the `DispatcherPortlet` is declared in the `portlet.xml` file of your web application:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<portlet>
		<portlet-name>sample</portlet-name>
		<portlet-class>com.liferay.portletmvc4spring.DispatcherPortlet</portlet-class>
		<supports>
			<mime-type>text/html</mime-type>
			<portlet-mode>view</portlet-mode>
		</supports>
		<portlet-info>
			<title>Sample Portlet</title>
		</portlet-info>
	</portlet>
----

The `DispatcherPortlet` now needs to be configured.

In PortletMVC4Spring, each `DispatcherPortlet` has its own `WebApplicationContext`, which inherits all the beans already
defined in the Root `WebApplicationContext`. These inherited beans can be overridden in the portlet-specific scope, and
new scope-specific beans can be defined local to a given portlet instance.

The framework will, on initialization of a `DispatcherPortlet`, look for a file named `[portlet-name]-portlet.xml` in
the `WEB-INF` directory of your web application and create the beans defined there (overriding the definitions of any
beans defined with the same name in the global scope).

The config location used by the `DispatcherPortlet` can be modified through a portlet initialization parameter (see
below for details).

The PortletMVC4Spring `DispatcherPortlet` has a few special beans it uses, in order to be able to process requests and
render the appropriate views. These beans are included in the Spring framework and can be configured in the
`WebApplicationContext`, just as any other bean would be configured. Each of those beans is described in more detail
below. Right now, we'll just mention them, just to let you know they exist and to enable us to go on talking about the
`DispatcherPortlet`. For most of the beans, defaults are provided so you don't have to worry about configuring them.

[[portlet-webappctx-special-beans-tbl]]
.Special beans in the WebApplicationContext
[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Expression| Explanation

| handler mapping(s)
| (<<portlet-handlermapping>>) a list of pre- and post-processors and controllers that will be executed if they match
  certain criteria (for instance a matching portlet mode specified with the controller)

| controller(s)
| (<<portlet-annotation>>) the beans providing the actual functionality (or at least, access to the functionality) as
  part of the MVC triad

| view resolver
| (<<portlet-viewresolver>>) capable of resolving view names to view definitions

| multipart resolver
| (<<portlet-multipart>>) offers functionality to process file uploads from HTML forms

| handler exception resolver
| (<<portlet-ann-exceptionhandler]>>) offers functionality to map exceptions to views or implement other more complex
  exception handling code
|===

When a `DispatcherPortlet` is setup for use and a request comes in for that specific `DispatcherPortlet`, it starts
processing the request. The list below describes the complete process a request goes through if handled by a
`DispatcherPortlet`:

. The locale returned by `PortletRequest.getLocale()` is bound to the request to let elements in the process resolve the
locale to use when processing the request (rendering the view, preparing data, etc.).
. If a multipart resolver is specified and this is an `ActionRequest`, the request is inspected for multiparts and if
they are found, it is wrapped in a `MultipartActionRequest` for further processing by other elements in the process.
(See <<portlet-multipart>> for further information about multipart handling).
. If a multipart resolver is specified and this is an `ResourceRequest`, the request is inspected for multiparts and if
they are found, it is wrapped in a `MultipartResourceRequest` for further processing by other elements in the process.
(See <<portlet-multipart>> for further information about multipart handling).
. An appropriate handler is searched for. If a handler is found, the execution chain associated with the handler (pre-
processors, post-processors, controllers) will be executed in order to prepare a model.
. If a model is returned, the view is rendered, using the view resolver that has been configured with the
`WebApplicationContext`. If no model is returned (which could be due to a pre- or post-processor intercepting the
request, for example, for security reasons), no view is rendered, since the request could already have been fulfilled.

Exceptions that are thrown during processing of the request get picked up by any of the handler exception resolvers that
are declared in the `WebApplicationContext`. Using these exception resolvers you can define custom behavior in case such
exceptions get thrown.

You can customize Spring's `DispatcherPortlet` by adding context parameters in the `portlet.xml` file or portlet
init-parameters. The possibilities are listed below.

[[portlet-dpp-init-params]]
.DispatcherPortlet initialization parameters
[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Parameter| Explanation

| `contextClass`
| Class that implements `WebApplicationContext`, which will be used to instantiate the context used by this portlet. If
  this parameter isn't specified, the `XmlPortletApplicationContext` will be used.

| `contextConfigLocation`
| String which is passed to the context instance (specified by `contextClass`) to indicate where context(s) can be
  found. The String is potentially split up into multiple Strings (using a comma as a delimiter) to support multiple
  contexts (in case of multiple context locations, for beans that are defined twice, the latest takes precedence).

| `namespace`
| The namespace of the `WebApplicationContext`. Defaults to `[portlet-name]-portlet`.

| `viewRendererUrl`
| The URL at which `DispatcherPortlet` can access an instance of `ViewRendererServlet` (see <<portlet-viewservlet>>).
|===




[[portlet-viewservlet]]
== The ViewRendererServlet

The rendering process in PortletMVC4Spring is a bit more complex than in Spring Web MVC. In order to reuse all the view
technologies from Spring Web MVC, the `PortletRequest` / `PortletResponse` must be converted to `HttpServletRequest` /
`HttpServletResponse` and then call the `render` method of the `View`. To do this, `DispatcherPortlet` uses a special
servlet that exists for just this purpose: the `ViewRendererServlet`.

In order for `DispatcherPortlet` rendering to work, you must declare an instance of the `ViewRendererServlet` in the
`web.xml` file for your web application as follows:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<servlet>
		<servlet-name>ViewRendererServlet</servlet-name>
		<servlet-class>com.liferay.portletmvc4spring.ViewRendererServlet</servlet-class>
	</servlet>

	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>ViewRendererServlet</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/WEB-INF/servlet/view</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>
----

To perform the actual rendering, `DispatcherPortlet` does the following:

. Binds the `WebApplicationContext` to the request as an attribute under the same `WEB_APPLICATION_CONTEXT_ATTRIBUTE`
key that `DispatcherServlet` uses.
. Binds the `Model` and `View` objects to the request to make them available to the `ViewRendererServlet`.
. Constructs a `PortletRequestDispatcher` and performs an `include` using the `/WEB-INF/servlet/view` URL that is mapped
to the `ViewRendererServlet`.

The `ViewRendererServlet` is then able to call the `render` method on the `View` with the appropriate arguments.

The actual URL for the `ViewRendererServlet` can be changed using `DispatcherPortlet`'s `viewRendererUrl` configuration
parameter.




[[portlet-annotation]]
== Annotation-Based Controller Programming Model
Version 2.5 of the Spring Framework introduced an annotation-based programming model for MVC controllers, using
annotations such as `@RequestMapping`, `@RequestParam`, `@ModelAttribute`, etc. This annotation support is available for
both Spring Web MVC and PortletMVC4Spring. Controllers implemented in this style do not have to extend specific base
classes or implement specific interfaces. Furthermore, they do not usually have direct dependencies on Servlet or
Portlet APIs, although they can easily get access to Servlet or Portlet facilities if desired.

The following sections document these annotations and how they are most commonly used in a Portlet environment.



[[portlet-ann-setup]]
=== Setting up the Dispatcher for Annotation Support
__The `@RequestMapping` annotation will only be processed if a corresponding `HandlerMapping` (for type level
annotations) and/or `HandlerAdapter` (for method level annotations) is present in the dispatcher.__ This is the case by
default in both `DispatcherServlet` and `DispatcherPortlet`.

However, if you are defining custom `HandlerMappings` or `HandlerAdapters`, then you need to make sure that a
corresponding custom `DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping` and/or `PortletRequestMappingHandlerAdapter` is defined as well -
provided that you intend to use `@RequestMapping`.

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

		<bean class="com.liferay.portletmvc4spring.mvc.annotation.DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping"/>

		<bean class="com.liferay.portletmvc4spring.mvc.method.annotation.PortletRequestMappingHandlerAdapter"/>

		// ... (controller bean definitions) ...

	</beans>
----

Defining a `DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping` and/or `PortletRequestMappingHandlerAdapter` explicitly also makes sense if
you would like to customize the mapping strategy, e.g. specifying a custom `WebBindingInitializer` (see below).



[[portlet-ann-controller]]
=== Defining a Controller with @Controller

The `@Controller` annotation indicates that a particular class serves the role of a __controller__. There is no need to
extend any controller base class or reference the Portlet API. You are of course still able to reference
Portlet-specific features if you need to.

The basic purpose of the `@Controller` annotation is to act as a stereotype for the annotated class, indicating its
role. The dispatcher will scan such annotated classes for mapped methods, detecting `@RequestMapping` annotations (see
the next section).

Annotated controller beans may be defined explicitly, using a standard Spring bean definition in the dispatcher's
context. However, the `@Controller` stereotype also allows for autodetection, aligned with Spring's general support for
detecting component classes in the classpath and auto-registering bean definitions for them.

To enable autodetection of such annotated controllers, you have to add component scanning to your configuration. This is
easily achieved by using the __spring-context__ schema as shown in the following XML snippet:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		xmlns:p="http://www.springframework.org/schema/p"
		xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
		xsi:schemaLocation="
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
			http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd">

		<context:component-scan base-package="org.springframework.samples.petportal.portlet"/>

		// ...

	</beans>
----



[[portlet-ann-requestmapping]]
=== Mapping Requests with @RequestMapping

The `@RequestMapping` annotation is used to map portlet modes like 'VIEW'/'EDIT' onto an entire class or a particular
handler method. Typically the type-level annotation maps a specific mode (or mode plus parameter condition) onto a form
controller, with additional method-level annotations 'narrowing' the primary mapping for specific portlet request
parameters.

[TIP]
====

`@RequestMapping` at the type level may be used for plain implementations of the `Controller` interface as well. In this
case, the request processing code would follow the traditional `handle(Action|Render)Request` signature, while the
controller's mapping would be expressed through an `@RequestMapping` annotation. This works for pre-built `Controller`
base classes, such as `AbstractController`, too.

In the following discussion, we'll focus on controllers that are based on annotated handler methods.
====

The following is an example of a form controller from the PetPortal sample application
using this annotation:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	@RequestMapping("EDIT")
	@SessionAttributes("site")
	public class PetSitesEditController {

		private Properties petSites;

		public void setPetSites(Properties petSites) {
			this.petSites = petSites;
		}

		@ModelAttribute("petSites")
		public Properties getPetSites() {
			return this.petSites;
		}

		@RequestMapping // default (action=list)
		public String showPetSites() {
			return "petSitesEdit";
		}

		@RequestMapping(params = "action=add") // RENDER_PHASE
		public String showSiteForm(Model model) {
			// Used for the initial form as well as for redisplaying with errors.
			if (!model.containsAttribute("site")) {
				model.addAttribute("site", new PetSite());
			}

			return "petSitesAdd";
		}

		@RequestMapping(params = "action=add") // ACTION_PHASE
		public void populateSite(@ModelAttribute("site") PetSite petSite,
				BindingResult result, SessionStatus status, ActionResponse response) {
			new PetSiteValidator().validate(petSite, result);
			if (!result.hasErrors()) {
				this.petSites.put(petSite.getName(), petSite.getUrl());
				status.setComplete();
				response.setRenderParameter("action", "list");
			}
		}

		@RequestMapping(params = "action=delete")
		public void removeSite(@RequestParam("site") String site, ActionResponse response) {
			this.petSites.remove(site);
			response.setRenderParameter("action", "list");
		}
	}
----

There are dedicated `@ActionMapping` and `@RenderMapping` (as well as `@ResourceMapping` and `@EventMapping`)
annotations which can be used instead:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	@RequestMapping("EDIT")
	@SessionAttributes("site")
	public class PetSitesEditController {

		private Properties petSites;

		public void setPetSites(Properties petSites) {
			this.petSites = petSites;
		}

		@ModelAttribute("petSites")
		public Properties getPetSites() {
			return this.petSites;
		}

		@RenderMapping // default (action=list)
		public String showPetSites() {
			return "petSitesEdit";
		}

		@RenderMapping(params = "action=add")
		public String showSiteForm(Model model) {
			// Used for the initial form as well as for redisplaying with errors.
			if (!model.containsAttribute("site")) {
				model.addAttribute("site", new PetSite());
			}

			return "petSitesAdd";
		}

		@ActionMapping(params = "action=add")
		public void populateSite(@ModelAttribute("site") PetSite petSite,
				BindingResult result, SessionStatus status, ActionResponse response) {
			new PetSiteValidator().validate(petSite, result);
			if (!result.hasErrors()) {
				this.petSites.put(petSite.getName(), petSite.getUrl());
				status.setComplete();
				response.setRenderParameter("action", "list");
			}
		}

		@ActionMapping(params = "action=delete")
		public void removeSite(@RequestParam("site") String site, ActionResponse response) {
			this.petSites.remove(site);
			response.setRenderParameter("action", "list");
		}
	}
----



[[portlet-ann-requestmapping-arguments]]
=== Supported Handler Method Arguments
Handler methods which are annotated with `@RequestMapping` are allowed to have very flexible signatures. They may have
arguments of the following types, in arbitrary order (except for validation results, which need to follow right after
the corresponding command object, if desired):

* Request and/or response objects (Portlet API). You may choose any specific request/response type, e.g. PortletRequest
  / ActionRequest / RenderRequest. An explicitly declared action/render argument is also used for mapping specific
  request types onto a handler method (in case of no other information given that differentiates between action and
  render requests).
* Session object (Portlet API): of type PortletSession. An argument of this type will enforce the presence of a
  corresponding session. As a consequence, such an argument will never be `null`.
* Preferences (Portlet API): of type PortletPreferences.
* `org.springframework.web.context.request.WebRequest` or `org.springframework.web.context.request.NativeWebRequest`.
  Allows for generic request parameter access as well as request/session attribute access, without ties to the native
  Servlet/Portlet API.
* `java.util.Locale` for the current request locale (the portal locale in a Portlet environment).
* `java.util.TimeZone` / `java.time.ZoneId` for the current request time zone.
* `java.io.InputStream` / `java.io.Reader` for access to the request's content. This will be the raw InputStream/Reader
  as exposed by the Portlet API.
* `java.io.OutputStream` / `java.io.Writer` for generating the response's content. This will be the raw
  OutputStream/Writer as exposed by the Portlet API.
* `@RequestParam` annotated parameters for access to specific Portlet request parameters. Parameter values will be
  converted to the declared method argument type.
* `java.util.Map` / `org.springframework.ui.Model` / `org.springframework.ui.ModelMap` for enriching the implicit model
  that will be exposed to the web view.
* Command/form objects to bind parameters to: as bean properties or fields, with customizable type conversion, depending
  on `@InitBinder` methods and/or the HandlerAdapter configuration - see the " `webBindingInitializer`" property on
  `PortletRequestMappingHandlerAdapter`. Such command objects along with their validation results will be exposed as
  model attributes, by default using the non-qualified command class name in property notation (e.g. "orderAddress" for
  type "mypackage.OrderAddress"). Specify a parameter-level `ModelAttribute` annotation for declaring a specific model
  attribute name.
* `org.springframework.validation.Errors` / `org.springframework.validation.BindingResult` validation results for a
  preceding command/form object (the immediate preceding argument).
* `org.springframework.web.bind.support.SessionStatus` status handle for marking form processing as complete (triggering
  the cleanup of session attributes that have been indicated by the `@SessionAttributes` annotation at the handler type
  level).

The following return types are supported for handler methods:

* A `ModelAndView` object, with the model implicitly enriched with command objects and the results of `@ModelAttribute`
  annotated reference data accessor methods.
* A `Model` object, with the view name implicitly determined through a `RequestToViewNameTranslator` and the model
  implicitly enriched with command objects and the results of `@ModelAttribute` annotated reference data accessor
  methods.
* A `Map` object for exposing a model, with the view name implicitly determined through a `RequestToViewNameTranslator`
  and the model implicitly enriched with command objects and the results of `@ModelAttribute` annotated reference data
  accessor methods.
* A `View` object, with the model implicitly determined through command objects and `@ModelAttribute` annotated
  reference data accessor methods. The handler method may also programmatically enrich the model by declaring a `Model`
  argument (see above).
* A `String` value which is interpreted as view name, with the model implicitly determined through command objects and
  `@ModelAttribute` annotated reference data accessor methods. The handler method may also programmatically enrich the
  model by declaring a `Model` argument (see above).
* `void` if the method handles the response itself (e.g. by writing the response content directly).
* Any other return type will be considered a single model attribute to be exposed to the view, using the attribute name
  specified through `@ModelAttribute` at the method level (or the default attribute name based on the return type's
  class name otherwise). The model will be implicitly enriched with command objects and the results of `@ModelAttribute`
  annotated reference data accessor methods.



[[portlet-ann-requestparam]]
=== Binding Request Parameters to Method Parameters with @RequestParam

The `@RequestParam` annotation is used to bind request parameters to a method parameter in your controller.

The following code snippet from the PetPortal sample application shows the usage:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	@RequestMapping("EDIT")
	@SessionAttributes("site")
	public class PetSitesEditController {

		// ...

		public void removeSite(@RequestParam("site") String site, ActionResponse response) {
			this.petSites.remove(site);
			response.setRenderParameter("action", "list");
		}

		// ...

	}
----

Parameters using this annotation are required by default, but you can specify that a parameter is optional by setting
`@RequestParam`'s `required` attribute to `false` (e.g., `@RequestParam(name="id", required=false)`).



[[portlet-ann-modelattrib]]
=== Providing a Link to Data from the Model with @ModelAttribute

`@ModelAttribute` has two usage scenarios in controllers. When placed on a method parameter, `@ModelAttribute` is used
to map a model attribute to the specific, annotated method parameter (see the `populateSite()` method below). This is
how the controller gets a reference to the object holding the data entered in the form. In addition, the parameter can
be declared as the specific type of the form backing object rather than as a generic `java.lang.Object`, thus increasing
type safety.

`@ModelAttribute` is also used at the method level to provide __reference data__ for the model (see the `getPetSites()`
method below). For this usage the method signature can contain the same types as documented above for the
`@RequestMapping` annotation.

[NOTE]
====
`@ModelAttribute` annotated methods will be executed __before__ the chosen
`@RequestMapping` annotated handler method. They effectively pre-populate the implicit model with specific attributes,
often loaded from a database. Such an attribute can then already be accessed through `@ModelAttribute` annotated handler
method parameters in the chosen handler method, potentially with binding and validation applied to it.
====

The following code snippet shows these two usages of this annotation:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	@RequestMapping("EDIT")
	@SessionAttributes("site")
	public class PetSitesEditController {

		// ...

		@ModelAttribute("petSites")
		public Properties getPetSites() {
			return this.petSites;
		}

		@RequestMapping(params = "action=add") // ACTION_PHASE
		public void populateSite( @ModelAttribute("site") PetSite petSite, BindingResult result, SessionStatus status, ActionResponse response) {
			new PetSiteValidator().validate(petSite, result);
			if (!result.hasErrors()) {
				this.petSites.put(petSite.getName(), petSite.getUrl());
				status.setComplete();
				response.setRenderParameter("action", "list");
			}
		}
	}
----



[[portlet-ann-sessionattrib]]
=== Specifying Attributes to Store in a Session with @SessionAttributes

The type-level `@SessionAttributes` annotation declares session attributes used by a specific handler. This will
typically list the names of model attributes or types of model attributes which should be transparently stored in the
session or some conversational storage, serving as form-backing beans between subsequent requests.

The following code snippet shows the usage of this annotation:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	@RequestMapping("EDIT")
	@SessionAttributes("site")
	public class PetSitesEditController {
		// ...
	}
----



[[portlet-ann-webdatabinder]]
=== Customizing WebDataBinder Initialization

To customize request parameter binding with PropertyEditors, etc. via the Spring Framework's `WebDataBinder`, you can
either use `@InitBinder`-annotated methods within your controller or externalize your configuration by providing a
custom `WebBindingInitializer`.


[[portlet-ann-initbinder]]
==== Customizing Data Binding with @InitBinder

Annotating controller methods with `@InitBinder` allows you to configure web data binding directly within your
controller class. `@InitBinder` identifies methods which initialize the `WebDataBinder` which will be used for
populating command and form object arguments of annotated handler methods.

Such init-binder methods support all arguments that `@RequestMapping` supports, except for command/form objects and
corresponding validation result objects. Init-binder methods must not have a return value. Thus, they are usually
declared as `void`. Typical arguments include `WebDataBinder` in combination with `WebRequest` or `java.util.Locale`,
allowing code to register context-specific editors.

The following example demonstrates the use of `@InitBinder` for configuring a `CustomDateEditor` for all
`java.util.Date` form properties.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class MyFormController {

		@InitBinder
		protected void initBinder(WebDataBinder webDataBinder) {
		    SimpleDateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd");
			dateFormat.setLenient(false);
			webDataBinder.registerCustomEditor(Date.class, new CustomDateEditor(dateFormat, false));
		}

		// ...

	}
----


[[portlet-ann-webbindinginitializer]]
==== Configuring a Custom WebBindingInitializer

To externalize data binding initialization, you can provide a custom implementation of the `WebBindingInitializer`
interface, which you then enable by supplying a custom bean configuration for an `PortletRequestMappingHandlerAdapter`,
thus overriding the default configuration.




[[portlet-ann-exceptionhandler]]
=== Exception Handling with @ExceptionHandler

If a controller method throws an exception, then methods annotated with `@ExceptionHandler` will be called in order to
provide a way for the developer to gracefully handle exceptions. The method signatures can take various different
arguments. The typical return type is `void` but if the method returns type `String` then the return value will be
written to the response as portlet markup. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
		@ExceptionHandler
		public void handleException(Exception ex, Writer writer) throws IOException {
			// Write the exception message to the response as portlet markup.
			writer.write(ex.getMessage());
		}

		@ExceptionHandler(IOException.class)
		public String handleIOException(IOException ex, PortletRequest request) {
			// Write the portlet lifecycle and exception message to the response
			// as portlet markup by returning a String.
			return portletRequest.getAttribute(PortletRequest.LIFECYCLE_PHASE) + ":" + ex.getMessage();
		}

		@ExceptionHandler({ BindException.class, IllegalArgumentException.class })
		public String handle1(Exception ex, PortletRequest request, PortletResponse response) {
			// Write the exception class name to the response by returning a String.
			return ClassUtils.getShortName(ex.getClass());
		}
----

[[portlet-viewresolver]]
== Views and View Resolvers
As mentioned previously, PortletMVC4Spring directly reuses all the view technologies from Spring Web MVC. This includes
not only the various `View` implementations themselves, but also the `ViewResolver` implementations. For more
information, refer to https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-view[View
Technologies] in the Spring Framework documentation.

[NOTE]
====
In order to help developers get started quickly, the PortletMVC4Spring project includes demos and Maven archetypes that
show how to use JSP and/or Thymeleaf. See the https://github.com/liferay/portletmvc4spring[Project Page at GitHub] for
more details.
====


A few items on using the existing `View` and `ViewResolver` implementations are worth mentioning:

* Most portals expect the result of rendering a portlet to be an HTML fragment. So, things like JSP/JSTL, Thymeleaf,
  Velocity, FreeMarker, and XSLT all make sense. But it is unlikely that views that return other document types will
  make any sense in a portlet context.
* There is no such thing as an HTTP redirect from within a portlet (the `sendRedirect(..)` method of `ActionResponse`
  cannot be used to stay within the portal). So, `RedirectView` and use of the `'redirect:'` prefix will __not__ work
  correctly from within PortletMVC4Spring.
* It may be possible to use the `'forward:'` prefix from within PortletMVC4Spring. However, remember that since you are
  in a portlet, you have no idea what the current URL looks like. This means you cannot use a relative URL to access
  other resources in your web application and that you will have to use an absolute URL.

Also, for JSP development, the new Spring Taglib and the new Spring Form Taglib both work in portlet views in exactly
the same way that they work in servlet views.




[[portlet-multipart]]
== Multipart (File Upload) Support
PortletMVC4Spring has built-in multipart support to handle file uploads in portlet applications, just like Spring Web
MVC does. The design for the multipart support is done with pluggable `PortletMultipartResolver` objects, defined in the
`com.liferay.portletmvc4spring.multipart` package. PortletMVC4Spring provides a `StandardPortletMultipartResolver`
for use with the JSR-362 standard file upload feature. For legacy purposes, it also provides a
`PortletMultipartResolver` for use with http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/fileupload[Commons FileUpload]. How uploading
files is supported will be described in the rest of this section.

By default, no multipart handling will be done by PortletMVC4Spring, as some developers will want to handle multiparts
themselves. You will have to enable it yourself by adding a multipart resolver to the web application's context. After
you have done that, `DispatcherPortlet` will inspect each request to see if it contains a multipart. If no multipart is
found, the request will continue as expected. However, if a multipart is found in the request, the
`PortletMultipartResolver` that has been declared in your context will be used. After that, the multipart attribute in
your request will be treated like any other attribute.

[NOTE]
====
Any configured `PortletMultipartResolver` bean __must__ have the following id (or name): "`portletMultipartResolver`".
If you have defined your `PortletMultipartResolver` with any other name, then the `DispatcherPortlet` will __not__ find
your `PortletMultipartResolver`, and consequently no multipart support will be in effect.
====



[[portlet-multipart-resolver]]
=== Using the PortletMultipartResolver

The following example shows how to use the `StandardPortletMultipartResolver`:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="portletMultipartResolver"
		class="com.liferay.portletmvc4spring.multipart.StandardPortletMultipartResolver">
	</bean>
----

Now that you have seen how to set PortletMVC4Spring up to handle multipart requests, let's talk about how to actually
use it. When `DispatcherPortlet` detects a multipart request, it activates the resolver that has been declared in your
context and hands over the request. What the resolver then does is wrap the current `PortletRequest` in either a
`MultipartActionRequest` or `MultipartResourceRequest` that has support for multipart file uploads. Using the wrapped
request, you can get information about the multiparts contained by this request and actually get access to the multipart
files themselves in your controllers.

[NOTE]
====
You can only receive multipart file uploads as part of an `ActionRequest` or `ResourceRequest`, but not as
part of an `EventRequest`, `HeaderRequest`, or `RenderRequest`.
====



[[portlet-multipart-forms]]
=== Handling a File Upload in a Form
After the `PortletMultipartResolver` has finished doing its job, the request will be processed like any other. To use
the `PortletMultipartResolver`, you must declare it in your Spring configuration descriptor:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="portletMultipartResolver"
		class="com.liferay.portletmvc4spring.multipart.StandardPortletMultipartResolver"/>
----

Next, create a form with an upload field:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<h1>Please upload one or more files</h1>
	<portlet:actionURL name="uploadFiles" var="fileUploadActionURL"/>
	<form:form action="${fileUploadActionURL}" enctype="multipart/form-data"
			method="post" modelAttribute="transientUpload">
		<input name="multipartFiles" multiple="multiple" type="file"/>
		<input type="submit"/>
	</form:form>
----

Next, create a Data Transfer Object (DTO) that will temporarily contain the uploaded file data during the scope of
of the request as it exists in the model. The DTO must have a JavaBeans property that matches the name of the input
field from the form (in this example, "multipartFiles") that will automatically be bound to the value of the submitted
files:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public class TransientUpload {

	private List<MultipartFile> multipartFiles = new ArrayList<>();

	public List<MultipartFile> getMultipartFiles() {
		return multipartFiles;
	}

	public void setMultipartFiles(List<MultipartFile> multipartFiles) {
		this.multipartFiles = multipartFiles;
	}
}
----

Finally, create the controller that processes the uploaded files from the model:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	@RequestMapping("VIEW")
	public class FileUploadController {

		@ActionMapping("uploadFiles")
		public void uploadFiles(
			@ModelAttribute("transientUpload") TransientUpload transientUpload) {

			List<MultipartFile> transientMultipartFiles = transientUpload.getMultipartFiles();

			if (transientMultipartFiles != null) {

				for (MultipartFile transientMultipartFile : transientMultipartFiles) {
					// process file
				}
			}
		}
	}
----

[NOTE]
====
Instead of receiving uploaded files as type `MultipartFile`, it is possible to register custom editors so that
PortletMVC4Spring can leverage the Spring Web MVC feature to convert uploaded files to byte arrays or Strings.
====

The following code snippet shows an example of how to register custom editors that facilitate file upload conversion:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@InitBinder
	protected void initBinder(WebDataBinder webDataBinder) {

		// Ability to convert uploaded files to byte arrays so that the
		// `TransientFileUpload` calss can contain List<byte[]> instead
		// of List<MultipartFile>
		webDataBinder.registerCustomEditor(byte[].class,
			new org.springframework.web.multipart.support.ByteArrayMultipartFileEditor());

		// Ability to convert uploaded files to strings so that the
		// TransientFileUpload class can contain List<String> instead
		// of List<MultipartFile>
		webDataBinder.registerCustomEditor(String.class,
			new org.springframework.web.multipart.support.StringMultipartFileEditor());
	}
----




[[portlet-deployment]]
== Portlet Application Deployment
The process of deploying a PortletMVC4Spring application is no different than deploying any JSR-362 portlet application.
Generally, the portal/portlet container runs in one webapp in your servlet container and your portlets run in another
webapp in your servlet container. In order for the portlet container webapp to make calls into your portlet webapp it
must make cross-context calls to a well-known servlet that provides access to the portlet services defined in your
`portlet.xml` file.

The JSR-362 specification does not specify exactly how this should happen, so each portlet container has its own
mechanism for this, which usually involves some kind of "deployment process" that makes changes to the portlet webapp
itself and then registers the portlets within the portlet container.

At a minimum, the `web.xml` file in your portlet webapp is modified to inject the well-known servlet that the portlet
container will call. In some cases a single servlet will service all portlets in the webapp, in other cases there will
be an instance of the servlet for each portlet.

Some portlet containers will also inject libraries and/or configuration files into the webapp as well. The portlet
container must also make its implementation of the Portlet JSP Tag Library available to your webapp.

The bottom line is that it is important to understand the deployment needs of your target portal and make sure they are
met (usually by following the automated deployment process it provides). Be sure to carefully review the documentation
from your portal for this process.

Once you have deployed your portlet, review the resulting `web.xml` file for sanity. Some older portals have been known
to corrupt the definition of the `ViewRendererServlet`, thus breaking the rendering of your portlets.




[[portlet-exceptionresolver]]
== Legacy Exception Handling
Just like Spring Web MVC, PortletMVC4Spring provides ``HandlerExceptionResolver``s to ease the pain of unexpected
exceptions that occur while your request is being processed by a handler that matched the request. PortletMVC4Spring
also provides a portlet-specific, concrete `SimpleMappingExceptionResolver` that enables you to take the class name of
any exception that might be thrown and map it to a view name.




[[portlet-controller]]
== Legacy Controller Programming Model

[NOTE]
====
The legacy controller programing model is not recommended for new development. Instead, the annotation-driven controller
programming model should be considered.
====

The __legacy__ controller programming model in PortletMVC4Spring are very similar to Spring Web MVC controllers.

The basis for the PortletMVC4Spring controller architecture is the `com.liferay.portletmvc4spring.mvc.Controller`
interface, which is listed below.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	public interface Controller {

		/**
		 * Process the render request and return a ModelAndView object which the
		 * DispatcherPortlet will render.
		 */
		ModelAndView handleRenderRequest(RenderRequest request,
				RenderResponse response) throws Exception;

		/**
		 * Process the action request. There is nothing to return.
		 */
		void handleActionRequest(ActionRequest request,
				ActionResponse response) throws Exception;

	}
----

As you can see, the Portlet `Controller` interface requires two methods that handle the two phases of a portlet request:
the action request and the render request. The `ACTION_PHASE` should be capable of handling an action request, and the
`RENDER_PHASE` should be capable of handling a render request and returning an appropriate model and view. While the
`Controller` interface is quite abstract, PortletMVC4Spring offers several controllers that already contain a lot of the
functionality you might need; most of these are very similar to controllers from Spring Web MVC. The `Controller`
interface just defines the most common functionality required of every controller: handling an action request, handling
a render request, and returning a model and a view.



[[portlet-controller-abstractcontroller]]
=== AbstractController and PortletContentGenerator

Of course, just a `Controller` interface isn't enough. To provide a basic infrastructure, all of PortletMVC4Spring's
``Controller``s inherit from `AbstractController`, a class offering access to Spring's `ApplicationContext` and control
over caching.

[[portlet-ac-features]]
.Features offered by the AbstractController
[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Parameter| Explanation

| `requireSession`
| Indicates whether or not this `Controller` requires a session to do its work. This feature is offered to all
  controllers. If a session is not present when such a controller receives a request, the user is informed using a
  `SessionRequiredException`.

| `synchronizeSession`
| Use this if you want handling by this controller to be synchronized on the user's session. To be more specific, the
  extending controller will override the `handleRenderRequestInternal(..)` and `handleActionRequestInternal(..)`
  methods, which will be synchronized on the user's session if you specify this variable.

| `renderWhenMinimized`
| If you want your controller to actually render the view when the portlet is in a minimized state, set this to true. By
  default, this is set to false so that portlets that are in a minimized state don't display any content.

| `cacheSeconds`
| When you want a controller to override the default cache expiration defined for the portlet, specify a positive
  integer here. By default it is set to `-1`, which does not change the default caching. Setting it to `0` will ensure
  the result is never cached.
|===

The `requireSession` and `cacheSeconds` properties are declared on the `PortletContentGenerator` class, which is the
superclass of `AbstractController`) but are included here for completeness.

When using the `AbstractController` as a base class for your controllers (which is not recommended since there are a lot
of other controllers that might already do the job for you) you only have to override either the
`handleActionRequestInternal(ActionRequest, ActionResponse)` method or the `handleRenderRequestInternal(RenderRequest,
RenderResponse)` method (or both), implement your logic, and return a `ModelAndView` object (in the case of
`handleRenderRequestInternal`).

The default implementations of both `handleActionRequestInternal(..)` and `handleRenderRequestInternal(..)` throw a
`PortletException`. This is consistent with the behavior of `GenericPortlet` from the JSR-362 Specification Portlet 3.0
API. So you only need to override the method that your controller is intended to handle.

Here is short example consisting of a class and a declaration in the web application context.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	package samples;

	import javax.portlet.RenderRequest;
	import javax.portlet.RenderResponse;

	import com.liferay.portletmvc4spring.mvc.AbstractController;
	import com.liferay.portletmvc4spring.ModelAndView;

	public class SampleController extends AbstractController {

		public ModelAndView handleRenderRequestInternal(RenderRequest request, RenderResponse response) {
			ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView("foo");
			mav.addObject("message", "Hello World!");
			return mav;
		}

	}
----

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="sampleController" class="samples.SampleController">
		<property name="cacheSeconds" value="120"/>
	</bean>
----

The class above and the declaration in the web application context is all you need besides setting up a handler mapping
(see <<portlet-handlermapping>>) to get this very simple controller working.



[[portlet-controller-simple]]
=== Other simple controllers
Although you can extend `AbstractController`, PortletMVC4Spring provides a number of concrete implementations which
offer functionality that is commonly used in simple MVC applications.

The `ParameterizableViewController` is basically the same as the example above, except for the fact that you can specify
the view name that it will return in the web application context (no need to hard-code the view name).

The `PortletModeNameViewController` uses the current mode of the portlet as the view name. So, if your portlet is in
View mode (i.e. `PortletMode.VIEW`) then it uses "view" as the view name.




[[portlet-controller-wrapping]]
=== PortletWrappingController

Instead of developing new controllers, it is possible to use existing portlets and map requests to them from a
`DispatcherPortlet`. Using the `PortletWrappingController`, you can instantiate an existing `Portlet` as a `Controller`
as follows:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean id="myPortlet" class="com.liferay.portletmvc4spring.mvc.PortletWrappingController">
		<property name="portletClass" value="sample.MyPortlet"/>
		<property name="portletName" value="my-portlet"/>
		<property name="initParameters">
			<value>config=/WEB-INF/my-portlet-config.xml</value>
		</property>
	</bean>
----

This can be very valuable since you can then use interceptors to pre-process and post-process requests going to these
portlets. Alternatively, you can use a portlet filter as defined by the JSR-362 Specification.




[[portlet-handlermapping]]
== Handler Mappings
Using a handler mapping you can map incoming portlet requests to appropriate handlers. There are some handler mappings
you can use out of the box, for example, the `PortletModeHandlerMapping`, but let's first examine the general concept of
a `HandlerMapping`.

[NOTE]
====
The term "Handler" is intentionally used here instead of "Controller". `DispatcherPortlet` is designed to be used
with other ways to process requests than just PortletMVC4Spring's own Controllers. A Handler is any Object that can
handle portlet requests. Controllers are an example of Handlers, and they are of course the default. To use some other
framework with `DispatcherPortlet`, a corresponding implementation of `HandlerAdapter` is all that is needed.
====

The functionality a basic `HandlerMapping` provides is the delivering of a `HandlerExecutionChain`, which must contain
the handler that matches the incoming request, and may also contain a list of handler interceptors that are applied to
the request. When a request comes in, the `DispatcherPortlet` will hand it over to the handler mapping to let it inspect
the request and come up with an appropriate `HandlerExecutionChain`. Then the `DispatcherPortlet` will execute the
handler and interceptors in the chain (if any). These concepts are all exactly the same as in Spring Web MVC.

The concept of configurable handler mappings that can optionally contain interceptors (executed before or after the
actual handler was executed, or both) is extremely powerful. A lot of supporting functionality can be built into a
custom `HandlerMapping`. Think of a custom handler mapping that chooses a handler not only based on the portlet mode of
the request coming in, but also on a specific state of the session associated with the request.

In Spring Web MVC, handler mappings are commonly based on URLs. Since there is really no such thing as a URL within a
Portlet, we must use other mechanisms to control mappings. The two most common are the portlet mode and a request
parameter, but anything available to the portlet request can be used in a custom handler mapping.

The rest of this section describes three of PortletMVC4Spring's most commonly used handler mappings. They all extend
`AbstractHandlerMapping` and share the following properties:

* `interceptors`: The list of interceptors to use. ``HandlerInterceptor``s are discussed in
  <<portlet-handlermapping-interceptor>>.
* `defaultHandler`: The default handler to use, when this handler mapping does not result in a matching handler.
* `order`: Based on the value of the order property (see the `org.springframework.core.Ordered` interface), Spring will
  sort all handler mappings available in the context and apply the first matching handler.
* `lazyInitHandlers`: Allows for lazy initialization of singleton handlers (prototype handlers are always lazily
  initialized). Default value is false. This property is directly implemented in the three concrete Handlers.



[[portlet-handlermapping-portletmode]]
=== PortletModeHandlerMapping

This is a simple handler mapping that maps incoming requests based on the current mode of the portlet (e.g. 'view',
'edit', 'help'). An example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean class="com.liferay.portletmvc4spring.handler.PortletModeHandlerMapping">
		<property name="portletModeMap">
			<map>
				<entry key="view" value-ref="viewHandler"/>
				<entry key="edit" value-ref="editHandler"/>
				<entry key="help" value-ref="helpHandler"/>
			</map>
		</property>
	</bean>
----



[[portlet-handlermapping-parameter]]
=== ParameterHandlerMapping

If we need to navigate around to multiple controllers without changing portlet mode, the simplest way to do this is with
a request parameter that is used as the key to control the mapping.

`ParameterHandlerMapping` uses the value of a specific request parameter to control the mapping. The default name of the
parameter is `'action'`, but can be changed using the `'parameterName'` property.

The bean configuration for this mapping will look something like this:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean class="com.liferay.portletmvc4spring.handler.ParameterHandlerMapping">
		<property name="parameterMap">
			<map>
				<entry key="add" value-ref="addItemHandler"/>
				<entry key="edit" value-ref="editItemHandler"/>
				<entry key="delete" value-ref="deleteItemHandler"/>
			</map>
		</property>
	</bean>
----



[[portlet-handlermapping-portletmodeparameter]]
=== PortletModeParameterHandlerMapping

The most powerful built-in handler mapping, `PortletModeParameterHandlerMapping` combines the capabilities of the two
previous ones to allow different navigation within each portlet mode.

Again the default name of the parameter is "action", but can be changed using the `parameterName` property.

By default, the same parameter value may not be used in two different portlet modes. This is so that if the portal
itself changes the portlet mode, the request will no longer be valid in the mapping.

The bean configuration for this mapping will look something like this:

[source,xml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	<bean class="com.liferay.portletmvc4spring.handler.PortletModeParameterHandlerMapping">
		<property name="portletModeParameterMap">
			<map>
				<entry key="view"> <!-- 'view' portlet mode -->
					<map>
						<entry key="add" value-ref="addItemHandler"/>
						<entry key="edit" value-ref="editItemHandler"/>
						<entry key="delete" value-ref="deleteItemHandler"/>
					</map>
				</entry>
				<entry key="edit"> <!-- 'edit' portlet mode -->
					<map>
						<entry key="prefs" value-ref="prefsHandler"/>
						<entry key="resetPrefs" value-ref="resetPrefsHandler"/>
					</map>
				</entry>
			</map>
		</property>
	</bean>
----

This mapping can be chained ahead of a `PortletModeHandlerMapping`, which can then provide defaults for each mode and an
overall default as well.



[[portlet-handlermapping-interceptor]]
=== Adding HandlerInterceptors

Spring's handler mapping mechanism has a notion of handler interceptors, which can be extremely useful when you want to
apply specific functionality to certain requests, for example, checking for a principal. Again PortletMVC4Spring
implements these concepts in the same way as Spring Web MVC.

Interceptors located in the handler mapping must implement `HandlerInterceptor` from the `com.liferay.portletmvc4spring`
package. Just like Spring Web MVC, this interface defines three methods: one that will be called before the actual
handler will be executed ( `preHandle`), one that will be called after the handler is executed (`postHandle`), and one
that is called after the complete request has finished (`afterCompletion`). These three methods should provide enough
flexibility to do all kinds of pre- and post- processing.

The `preHandle` method returns a boolean value. You can use this method to break or continue the processing of the
execution chain. When this method returns `true`, the handler execution chain will continue. When it returns `false`,
the `DispatcherPortlet` assumes the interceptor itself has taken care of requests (and, for example, rendered an
appropriate view) and does not continue executing the other interceptors and the actual handler in the execution chain.

The `postHandle` method is only called on a `RenderRequest`. The `preHandle` and `afterCompletion` methods are called on
both an `ActionRequest` and a `RenderRequest`. If you need to execute logic in these methods for just one type of
request, be sure to check what kind of request it is before processing it.



[[portlet-handlermapping-interceptoradapter]]
=== HandlerInterceptorAdapter

As with the servlet package, the portlet package has a concrete implementation of `HandlerInterceptor` called
`HandlerInterceptorAdapter`. This class has empty versions of all the methods so that you can inherit from this class
and implement just one or two methods when that is all you need.



[[portlet-handlermapping-parameterinterceptor]]
=== ParameterMappingInterceptor

The portlet package also has a concrete interceptor named `ParameterMappingInterceptor` that is meant to be used
directly with `ParameterHandlerMapping` and `PortletModeParameterHandlerMapping`. This interceptor will cause the
parameter that is being used to control the mapping to be forwarded from an `ActionRequest` to the subsequent
`RenderRequest`. This will help ensure that the `RenderRequest` is mapped to the same Handler as the `ActionRequest`.
This is done in the `preHandle` method of the interceptor, so you can still modify the parameter value in your handler
to change where the `RenderRequest` will be mapped.

Be aware that this interceptor is calling `setRenderParameter` on the `ActionResponse`, which means that you cannot call
`sendRedirect` in your handler when using this interceptor. If you need to do external redirects then you will either
need to forward the mapping parameter manually or write a different interceptor to handle this for you.
